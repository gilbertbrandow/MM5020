\section{Group Action on the Projective Line}

Let \( k = \mathbb{F}_7 = \mathbb{Z}/7\mathbb{Z} \). We define \( \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \) as the group of all invertible \( 2 \times 2 \) matrices with entries in the field \( k \). In other words,
\[
\mathrm{GL}_2(k) = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \in M_2(k) \ \middle| \ ad - bc \neq 0 \right\}.
\]

\subsection*{\(\mathrm{GL}_2(k)\) Forms a Group}

Let \( A, B \in \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \). Then the product \( AB \) is defined as:
\[
AB = \begin{pmatrix}
ae + bg & af + bh \\
ce + dg & cf + dh
\end{pmatrix},
\]
where all entries involve only addition and multiplication of elements in \( k \). Since \( k \) is a field, it is closed under addition and multiplication, so all entries of \( AB \) lie in \( k \). Furthermore, \( \det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B) \neq 0 \), so \( AB \in \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \). Thus, \( \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \) is closed under matrix multiplication.

Since matrix multiplication is associative, the operation on \( \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \) is associative.

The identity element in \( \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \) is the identity matrix
\[
I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
For any \( A \in \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \), we have \( AI = IA = A \), and since the entries \( 1 \) and \( 0 \) are in \( k \), we conclude \( I \in \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \).

Since every element of \( \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \) is invertible by definition, the inverse of
\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \in \mathrm{GL}_2(k)
\]
is given by:
\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Since \( a, b, c, d \in k \), and \( \det(A) = ad - bc \neq 0 \), we have \( \frac{1}{\det(A)} \in k \), because \( k \) is a field. As \( k \) is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, all entries of \( A^{-1} \) lie in \( k \). Hence, \( A^{-1} \in \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \).

Therefore, \( \mathrm{GL}_2(k) \) satisfies the group axioms under matrix multiplication and is a group.
